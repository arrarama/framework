    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 tracking-tight">FinOps Certified Professional</h2>
    <p class="text-base text-gray-600">
      This is the most in-depth and hands on FinOps training available. The FinOps Certified Professional program is designed for experienced FinOps practitioners who want to move to the next level to further their careers, further their knowledge in their current practice, and round out their FinOps knowledge with other professionals who have similar and varied backgrounds. This is an intensive course with 40-50 hours of anticipated work over several weeks. Much of the work will be self-paced but you will also be required to attend two virtual instructor-led trainings. We are excited for you to sign up and be the first to become a FinOps Certified Professional!

    <p class="text-base text-gray-600">
      If you are not a member of a FinOps team, but will be working with them, consider one of the Persona-based Training courses offered for Engineers, Finance, Product Managers, Procurement, or Executives. These shorter training courses cover the basics of FinOps with examples geared toward a particular persona.

## Curriculum of the training and certification

For an overview of the the general domains and competencies covered by the training and certification exam, see the [Linux Foundation’s FinOps certification page](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-finops/). It is based on the open source curriculum which resides on [Github](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/curriculum).


## What level of prerequisite knowledge do I need?

You should understand the basics of how cloud computing works, know the key services on your cloud providers, including their common use cases, and have a basic understanding of billing and pricing models. You should already be able to describe the basic value proposition of running in cloud and understand the core concept of using a pay-as-you-go consumption model.

You’ll also need to have a base level of knowledge of at least one of the three main public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). For AWS, we recommend AWS Business Professional training or, even better, the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. For Google, check out the Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals course. For Azure, try the Azure Fundamentals learning path. Each can usually be completed in a full day workshop.
