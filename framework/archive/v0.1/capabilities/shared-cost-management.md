# Shared Cost Management

## Introduction 

Every organization has shared IT costs, and these span multiple business departments. As organizations increase their adoption of public cloud resources, it becomes increasingly difficult to assign shared cloud resources to specific business owners, to understand how to properly and fairly allocate costs, and to actually forecast future business unit budgets.

## Sample Implementation      


## Common Approaches

There are typically three ways to split up shared costs:
- Proportional
Based on relative percentage of direct costs
- Even split
Split total amount evenly across targets
- Fixed
User-defined coefficient (the sum of coefficients needs to be 100%)

## Maturity Examples
