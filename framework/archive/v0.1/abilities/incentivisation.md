# Incentivisation

Shock horror finance is often not exciting to engineers. Asking them to optimise costs or improve efficiency is not among the high interest items. By incentivising FinOps asks we move the motivation into our favour. We have heard from companies implementing programs from a simple celebration board showing teams/individuals that have been successful in helping FinOps reach its goals, to t-shirt programs where the best ideas implemented by teams results in getting swag, all the way to measured cost reductions resulting in teams being allocated further staff members to grow their teams.
