# Data in the path of Engineers

Separation of FinOps data from the place engineers work causes a lack of engagement in FinOps by engineering teams. Engineers have formal processes of scheduling work for example Sprint Planning or via Kanban Boards and service owners have SRE metrics and operational/incident dashboards. When FinOps data (e.g. cost visibility, optimisation recommendations) is reported outside of the usual locations the expectation is that engineers will add checking into the new reporting systems to their workflows.

The concept of data in the path of engineers is to lower the effort required to add cost efficiency to the planning and prioritisation meetings they already run. Bringing the most important pieces of information that the FinOps practitioner would like considered/actioned by engineers into their existing reports and linking out to the normal FinOps reports/tooling for further information when they need it.
