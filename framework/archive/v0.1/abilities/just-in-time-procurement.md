# Just In Time Procurement

In order to take the most benefit from the variable cost model of the cloud engineers need to be enabled and encouraged to provision resources at the time they are needed versus pre-provisioning for future capacity. When building out your FinOps practice it is important to consider if any of the policies and processes implemented create an environment where teams find it easier to purchase cloud capacity ahead of time in order to avoid future issues with the processes slowing them down.

Common examples of this are when budget is removed if teams are unable to consume the spend within a set period of time, or when increases in running costs need to be explained by heavy reporting processes. In these situations it is easier for teams to provision large amounts of capacity and remove the variability in cloud spend.
