# Informed Ignoring

It is not uncommon to hear teams/companies say things like “Cost is not an important consideration for us” or “getting this migration done in time is more important than reducing costs”. We have even heard teams say things like “it doesn’t matter what it costs, it just has to get done”. Generally, we are not against these statements themselves but when they are used as a defence for not having to measure and monitor costs it more often than not leads to bill shock down the line.

Progressing to services running in the cloud when teams prioritise good/fast over cheap, it doesn’t excuse them from monitoring the amount of potential optimisations. Deciding to de-prioritise cost efficiency is often acceptable but expectations of the amount of extra spend and for how long should be set and tracked in order to maintain the business value of cloud spend.
