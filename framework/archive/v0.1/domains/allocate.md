# Allocate

## Introduction
Cloud provider bills are generally aligned to the amount of resources (compute, storage, network, etc.) used. This view of the world doesn’t inherently map back to an organization’s layout: teams, projects, features and business processes for budgeting and accounting. The Allocation domain is the mapping layer, where resources are assigned ownership, owners roll up into groups and organizations, etc.

This can be implemented in multiple ways with varying pros/cons, such as: by setting account boundaries, creating tags on resources, post-processing the bill in a data warehouse, and more. Regardless of the approach, the goal is the same: view your cloud bill through your organization’s unique perspective.


## Contributing Capabilities

 * [Resource Metadata (Tagging/Labeling)](/framework/capabilities/tagging-labeling/)
 * [Resource Hierarchy (Accounts, Subscriptions & Projects)](/framework/capabilities/resource-hierarchy/)
 * [Shared Cost Management](/framework/capabilities/shared-cost-management/)


## Maturity Examples

How to get started and what great looks like.

 * Crawl = Costs allocated primarily by Resource Hierarchy
 * Walk = Resource Metadata providing fine grained cost allocation
 * Run = High levels of Resource Metadata coverage, shared resources have costs represented in Showback/Chargebacks.

## Common KPIs

 * Percentage of spend allocated by Resource Metadata/Hierarchy
 * Amount of spend allocated from shared resources
 * Percentage of unused shared resources
