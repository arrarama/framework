# Rate Optimization

## Introduction

Remember the cloud bill is formulated by cost = usage * rate. The two methods of reducing the cloud bill are reducing usage and reducing the rate you pay. Rate optimization is the process of getting a better rate for the same resource. Unlike usage optimization rate optimization often comes with a commitment to the cloud service provider. Committing to use/spend a set amount over a particular term—often 12-36 months—enables the cloud service provider to provide a lower rate for the same usage. 

Successful rate optimization requires a deep level of understanding cloud billing and is often best analyzed over your entire cloud bill not on a team-by-team level. This is why one of the FinOps principles is for “A centralized team drives FinOps“ in which rate optimization is managed.
