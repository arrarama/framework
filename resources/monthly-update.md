</div>

It happened again this month: we have too many amazing speakers and content areas to cover! We hope you join hundreds of your peers at our session on Aug 19th, with over a dozen speakers across three topics:

### Keynotes:
### #1 Dealing with Data Transfer

Based on a lively [conversation in Slack](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/CNJPGNMMJ/p1627071180232200) started by Josh Bauman (EA), we’ve assembled a panel of FinOps experts from heavy streamers to discuss the ins/outs of data transfer cost management. This roster includes: Anders Hagman (Spotify), Teresa Meade (Electronic Arts), and others.

### #2 Adopting FinOps: Getting Organizational Buy-In

Chair Member Ashley Hromatko and Tech Lead Mike Eisenstein are back to present an updated executive buy-in deck for building a FinOps practice that the working group has been tackling. They will also unveil the new FinOps Framework poster that gives a one-page overview of the core tenants of the practice with Vas Markanastasakis. Also hear from Melvin Brown (US Gov OPM) and Natalie Daley (HSBC) on their stories and follow-along in [#wg-adopting-finops](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/C026T4HQK09).

### #3 Waste Reduction: Mountains vs Molehills

Borrowing from Joseph Daly’s post on the topic, we're opening up a conversation about how to tackle and prioritize the tiny inefficiencies of cloud (molehills) vs. the optimization opportunities that can transform value (mountains). Panelists include Andrew Brixton (Citrix), Melissa Lorton and Michael Kerns (Virtasant), Scott Meyer (Spotify), and Teresa Meade (EA) sharing their tales on tackling waste. Check out slack threads in [#aws](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/CNJPGNMMJ/p1627552385245600) and [#azure](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/CNJPJ3YDA/p1627552311081500) on this topic.

The event is free to approved FinOps Foundation members - [join here!](https://www.finops.org/membership/) It'll  also feature breakout rooms on each topic as well as updates from our various Working Groups and Technical Advisory Council. There will be breakouts sessions during the last 30 minutes.

### Event Schedule:

- 8am - Welcome and Introductions
- 8:15am - 9:30am Keynotes & Panels
- 9:30am - 10am Breakouts

### The 2nd annual International FinOps Day

When we joined the Linux Foundation last summer and held the first FinOps Day on Aug 20, 2020, we had around 1500 practitioner members and no vendor members. Today we are proud to host the over 4000 practitioner members and nearly 40 vendor members with a half dozen active workgroups contributing to the FinOps Framework.

**To celebrate, we are offering 25% off all self-paced training** ([FinOps Certified Practitioner](/training-certification/finops-certified-practitioner/) and [FinOps for Engineers](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/finops-for-engineers-training-self-paced-course-tickets-149961353445)), simply join the Summit to get the discount code and use it through Aug 20.
